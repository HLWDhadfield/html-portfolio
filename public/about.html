<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Pursued music for over ten years before deciding I liked money and wanted more of it. 

<p>I moved back in with my parents and got a ceritfication in IT. This led to working on a Help Desk, and eventually
moving into sales working as an Account Manager.</p> 

<p>Made the "big time" and scored a job with one of the most well-known cybersecurity
companies in the world. Sold my house and moved to Texas only to find that I hated outbound sales. Couldn't stand cold-calling
and wanted more autonomy. Wanted to gain the knowledge to build things so I'm taking Angela Yu's course. In the coming months, 
I will be looking to transition into a full-time web dev role with aspirations of eventually working in the blockchain sector.
</p> 

<p>
Can already tell that dev work fits me better than outbound sales
and I'm excited to learn everything I can and work on some awesome projects.
