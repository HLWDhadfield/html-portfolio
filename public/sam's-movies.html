<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>Great character study on a highly controversial figure.</p>

<h3>Dumb Money</h3>
<p>Awesome recap of the "GameStonk" hedge spearheaded by Reddit renegade "RoaringKitty". I only wish I had been involved.</p>

<h3>Dune: Part Two</h3>
<p>Beautifully shot Sci-Fi film. Interesting to see Paul Atreides' shift in demeanor.</p>
